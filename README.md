# NobleScript
ANTLR4/LLVM based compiler

# Planned features
## Milestone 1
- 2 types of variables: int and double,
- read and write operations,
- basic arithmetic operations,
- error messages,
- arrays,
- strings.

## Milestone 2
- compound statements,
- functions,
- variable scopes,
- dynamic types (type coercion).

# Examples

## Variables

NobleScript variables must be initialized during declaration.

```c
int a = 5;
double b = 5.5;
```

Variables cannot be 

## Types

Supported operators

## Compund statements

Supported delimiters, if, while
